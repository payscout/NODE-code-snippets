Node is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine designed to build scalable network applications. Node uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Nodes’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
